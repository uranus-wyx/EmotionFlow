# Emotion Flow: Real-Time Emotional Support with RLHF

### Abstract
This study proposes a multi-stage empathetic AI system
designed to support users experiencing mental distress by combining
emotion classification with emotionally supportive response generation.
We first evaluate a DistilBERT-based classifier for detecting emotional
states—such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation—in Reddit
posts. Subsequently, we assess the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learn-
ing from Human Feedback (RLHF) in enhancing the empathy and help-
fulness of AI-generated responses. An optional component investigates
the mood-regulating potential of personalized music recommendations.
Through these experiments, we aim to validate the model’s classification
performance, user preferences for empathetic interaction, and the thera-
peutic potential of emotion-aware content delivery.
